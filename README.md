# Cleverbot

This chatbot is using OpenAI's **GPT-3** language model, specifically the **text-davinci-002** version. This model is trained on a large dataset of text and is able to generate human-like responses to a wide range of prompts. The chatbot is implemented using the **Flask** web framework, which allows for the creation of web applications with Python. The chatbot takes user input in the form of text, sends it to the GPT-3 model, and receives a response which is then displayed to the user. The front-end of the chatbot is designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which allows for the creation of a user-friendly interface. The chatbot is also designed to be responsive and to work on multiple devices.
